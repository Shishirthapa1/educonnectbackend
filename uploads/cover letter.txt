Subject: Application for Software Engineering fellowship - Shishir Thapa

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full-stack developer at Leapfrog, as advertised on Facebook. 

I am a 20-year-old student studying BSc (Hons) Computer Science at Herald College, Kathmandu. I am particularly excited about this internship opportunity because I could learn a lot from the experienced mentors and seniors in the leapfrog. I would learn a lot about real-world projects and standard coding practices used in industries and organizations through this internship.

I am confident that my programming and software-developing skills would make me a valuable addition to the Leapfrog team.

I have attached my Resume for your review. I am eager to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the requirements of the internship in an interview. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Shishir Thapa
